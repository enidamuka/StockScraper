# StockScraper

### **Welcome!** 

StockScraper is a personal project we co-developed with a peer that pulls real-time stock data directly from Yahoo Finance’s website! The project is written entirely in Python, and it is currently intended to be used through the terminal, but we are working towards implementing a more user-friendly interface with Flask.

This application was developed to provide users with an easy method to access and analyze real time stock information. It only requires the user to input the four letter ticker of the desired stock, and then StockScraper will handle the rest. 

*Please note that this project is still under development!*

### Project Overview
We created this project to expand our technical skills and deepen our understanding of software development, while also integrating our shared interest in finance and stocks. 

Throughout the development of this project, we experimented with multiple unfamiliar Python modules in order to determine the best fit for our application’s needs. We ultimately decided to use 'BeautifulSoup', 'requests', and 'Flask', and then studied their documentation to learn these libraries and effectively utilize them. Additionally, we adhered to standard software development practices, including object-oriented programming principles and utilizing version control for effective collaboration.

Upcoming features include:
* Developing a web-based interface using Flask
* Improving management and storage of scraped data from multiple tickers
* Additional features for more in-depth stock analytics and calculations (such as comparisons between multiple stocks, calculating moving averages, trend/performance analysis, etc)
